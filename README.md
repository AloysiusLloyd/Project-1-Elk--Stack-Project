## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your diagram](Images/diagram_filename.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the ELK installation YAML file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - /etc/ansible/install-elk.yml

This document contains the following details:
- Description of the Topologu
- Access Policies

  - Beats in Use

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly redundant, in addition to restricting restricting to the network.
- It helps prevent overloading servers as well as optimizes productivity and maximizes uptime.It also adds resiliency by rerouting live traffic from one server to another causing it to eliminate single points of failure from attacks such as DDoS attack.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the serverand system files.
- Filebeat ships log files from specified locations and forwards them to the ELK stack.
- Metricbeat monitors traffic on your servers (CPU, Memory Usage, Disk Space used) by container.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function  | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway   | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web-1    | Web Server| 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web-2    | Web Server| 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |
| Web-3    | Web Server| 10.0.0.8   | Linux            |
| ELK      | Web Server| 10.1.0.5   | Linux            |


### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- 99.244.133.165

Machines within the network can only be accessed by Jump Box.
- Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM?  JumpBoxProvisioner
- What was its IP address? 10.0.0.4

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses    |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 |  99.244.133.165         |
| Web-1    | No                  |  10.0.0.5               |
| Web-2    | No                  |  10.0.0.6               |
| Web-3    | No                  |  10.0.0.8               |
| ELK      | No                  |  10.0.0.4,99.244.133.165|

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_
- One main advantage would be YAML Playbooks. It is the best alternative for configuration management/automation.
```
The playbook implements the following tasks:
    * Install docker.io
   		- name: Install docker.io
    			apt:
     			update_cache: yes
     			name: docker.io
     			state: present
 	* Install Python-pip
 		- name: Install pip3
    			apt:
     			force_apt_get: yes
     			name: python3-pip
     			state: present
    * Install: docker
   		- name: Install Docker python module
    			pip:
     			name: docker
     			state: present
    * Command: sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
 	- Launch docker container: elk
   		- name: download and launch a docker elk container
    			docker_container:
     			name: elk
     			image: sebp/elk:761
     			state: started
     			restart_policy: always
     			published_ports:
      			- 5601:5601
      			- 9200:9200
      			- 5044:5044
```


The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- Web-1 10.0.0.5 
- Web-2 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat and Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat is used to collect log files from specific files on remote machines.
- Filebeats can be files that are generated by Apache, Microsoft Azure tools, the Nginx web server, and MySQl databases.
- Metricbeats collects activity and status of the connected VMs. Here you can see CPU, memory usage, number of containers, etc.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the playbook file to /etc/ansible/.
- Update the host file to include...
- Run the playbook, and navigate to command line to check that the installation worked as expected.
- Playbook: install-elk.yml Location: /etc/ansible/install-elk.yml
- Edit the /etc/ansible/host file to add webserver/elkserver ip addresses
- /etc/ansible/hosts

_ Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
- Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? Hosts file.
-  How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on? Add a group in the hosts file for the ELK machine(s) and include the IP address(es).
- Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?
- http://13.90.135.92:5601/app/kibana#/home

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
